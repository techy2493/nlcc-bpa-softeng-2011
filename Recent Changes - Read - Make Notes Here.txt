Added Server - 2/4/11
--Server is a basic NetBeans Project

added 2 lines of code to the server but both are incorrect - 2/9/11
--both lines are used for the socket factory(i could not find a lot of information on how to do the code for this thats y its wrong)

Found a good website for sockets
--http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html
--good tutorial but I need to know our socket port number to test it out
---Any port will work above 1500

Got the sockets connecting(no error messages but no other sign of success) 2/14/2010


(3/3/11)
designed an error message system we may want to use to find errors faster and easier that before(ill add anouther .txt file called Error codes
added a variable for every item but the socket number in the database, it will make changing locations(if needed[as in ever]) easier than before
updated the codes already placed to the new system(could only find one but thought we had two)
