Added Server (Server is a basic NetBeans Project)


(2/9/11)Jeremy Shearin
added 2 lines of code to the server but both are incorrect
--both lines are used for the socket factory(i could not find a lot of information on how to do the code for this thats y its wrong)

Found a good website for sockets
--http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html
--good tutorial but I need to know our socket port number to test it out
---Any port will work above 1500


(2/14/2010)Jeremy Shearin
Got the sockets connecting(no error messages but no other sign of success) 


(3/3/11)Jeremy Shearin
designed an error message system we may want to use to find errors faster and easier than before(ill add anouther .txt file called Error codes
added a variable for every item but the socket number in the database, it will make changing locations(if needed[as in ever]) easier than before
updated the error codes already placed to the new system(could only find one but thought we had two)
copied the code from the testclient(which would not load) into the test building java client, I have not yet deleted the testclient
Reformated the Recent changes page to support multiple lines(one line per action instead of one line per day)

(3/7/11)Jeremy Shearin
finally got my testbuildingjavaclient code to commit, i had to place it in a folder to commit it so i put it in the testclient folder(no further down then that)
             -The file needs to be changed to main but im afraid if i do that ill lose it in a file somewhere not knowing what main.java is what

(3/10/11)Jeremy Shearin
Put code into the client that should send the username and password in a form like this      username , password
	-Cant Test right now but it shows no errors
	-the code is  output.writeBytes(Username + " , " +Password);
		output is the variable and there was no println option like the site im using shows - http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html
		further searching has conserned me, i only have the option to send the string as a string of bytes or a string of char
found a line of code to close the conection but not sure how to use it, page 13 of this pdf site/file - http://www.cn-java.com/download/data/book/socket_chat.pdf

(3/17/11)Jeremy Shearin
did major code fixes to fix and error that would have allowed the user to connect more than once(everytime he attacked and healed)
that fix also fixed an error that disconnected the user before it allowed for the actions
if the user does not get a connection he cannot do the actions(making testing harder but it had to be done)

Finished the client for the following actions(untill revision for actual gameplay)
	attack
	random dice
	heal
	Skip Turn
	quit
Tested with server and found that the server only goes crazy when it loses connection with me, i got it to stop while i was going through the actions but it lost control after i quit
the server accepted my first sent message "This is the output comments" and showed it on your screen
