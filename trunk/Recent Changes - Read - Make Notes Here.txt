Added Server (Server is a basic NetBeans Project)


(2/9/11)Jeremy Shearin
added 2 lines of code to the server but both are incorrect
--both lines are used for the socket factory(i could not find a lot of information on how to do the code for this thats y its wrong)

Found a good website for sockets
--http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html
--good tutorial but I need to know our socket port number to test it out
---Any port will work above 1500

Got the sockets connecting(no error messages but no other sign of success) 


(3/3/11)Jeremy Shearin
designed an error message system we may want to use to find errors faster and easier than before(ill add anouther .txt file called Error codes
added a variable for every item but the socket number in the database, it will make changing locations(if needed[as in ever]) easier than before
updated the error codes already placed to the new system(could only find one but thought we had two)
copied the code from the testclient(which would not load) into the test building java client, I have not yet deleted the testclient
Reformated the Recent changes page to support multiple lines(one line per action instead of one line per day)

(3/7/11)Jeremy Shearin
finally got my testbuildingjavaclient code to commit, i had to place it in a folder to commit it so i put it in the testclient folder(no further down then that)
             -The file needs to be changed to main but im afraid if i do that ill lose it in a file somewhere not knowing what main.java is what
